## ATS Check Output

```markdown
## ATS Compatibility Report

**ATS Compatibility Score:** 7/10

### Critical Issues (Will Cause Parse Failures)
✗ **Contact info in header** - Name/email/phone placed in document header; many ATS ignore headers
  - **Fix:** Move contact info to top of main body text

✗ **Two-column layout** - Skills listed in left sidebar column; reading order will scramble
  - **Fix:** Convert to single-column layout with skills section after experience

### Warning Issues (May Cause Confusion)
⚠️ **Special characters** - Using arrows (→) and checkmarks (✓) in bullet points
  - **Fix:** Replace with standard hyphens (-) or asterisks (*)

⚠️ **Non-standard section header** - "My Professional Journey" instead of "Experience"
  - **Fix:** Change to "Professional Experience" or "Work History"

⚠️ **Inconsistent dates** - Mix of "MM/YYYY" and "Month YYYY" formats
  - **Fix:** Standardize to one format throughout (recommend "MMM YYYY")

### Parsing Test Results
- ✓ Name extracted correctly
- ✗ Email not found (in header)
- ✓ Experience section identified
- ⚠️ Skills section may be missed (sidebar location)
- ✓ Education parsed correctly

### Recommended Actions
1. Move contact info from header to body (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. Convert to single-column layout (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Replace special characters with standard equivalents
4. Rename section headers to standard labels
5. Standardize date formatting
```

## Rejection Reasons Output

```markdown
## Rejection Risk Analysis

### Identified Triggers

**1. Employment Gap (Critical)**
- **Issue:** 8-month gap (Jan-Aug 2023) with no explanation
- **Recruiter interpretation:** Unable to find work? Skills outdated?
- **Mitigation:** Add entry: "Career Break | Skill Development | Jan-Aug 2023" with relevant courses/certifications completed

**2. Job-Hopping Pattern (Moderate)**
- **Issue:** 4 roles in 3 years (2020-2023), all <12 months
- **Recruiter interpretation:** Can't commit, can't pass probation, always looking
- **Mitigation:** If contract work, group under "Independent Consultant" umbrella. If full-time, add context notes explaining departures

**3. Generic Objective (Minor)**
- **Issue:** "Seeking challenging opportunity in dynamic organization"
- **Recruiter interpretation:** Mass-applied without tailoring
- **Mitigation:** Replace with targeted summary mentioning specific company/role/domain

### Overall Risk Level: HIGH
**Recommendation:** Address critical and moderate issues before submitting. Without fixes, likelihood of quick rejection is high.

**Bullet Point Rewriting**
- Tools: ChatGPT, Claude, specialized resume tools
- Example: "Make this bullet point stronger"
- **Caution:** Ensure AI doesn't exaggerate or invent metrics
- **Required review:** Verify all facts, numbers, and claims remain accurate

**Cover Letter Drafting**
- Tools: ChatGPT with your background info
- Example: "Draft a cover letter for [role] emphasizing [skills]"
- **Caution:** AI voice often sounds generic/impersonal
- **Required review:** Rewrite in your authentic voice, add specific company research

- Example: "Help me write a compelling LinkedIn About section"
- **Caution:** Avoid buzzword-heavy, soulless language
- **Required review:** Ensure it sounds like you, not a corporate robot

---

### ❌ Red Light (Avoid Entirely)

**Fabricating Experiences**
- Example: "Add a project where I led a team of 10"
- Why dangerous: Will be exposed in interview, destroys credibility permanently
- Alternative: Highlight actual leadership experiences, even if smaller scale

**Generating Fake Metrics**
- Example: "Make my achievements sound more impressive with numbers"
- Why dangerous: Specific claims will be probed in interview
- Alternative: Use scope indicators (team size, user count) if exact metrics unavailable

**Automated Mass Applications**
- Example: Bot applying to 500 jobs with your resume
- Why dangerous: No quality control, may submit to wrong roles, can't track submissions
- Alternative: Apply to fewer roles with higher quality tailoring

**Having AI Answer Application Questions**
- Example: "Why do you want to work here?" answered by ChatGPT
- Why dangerous: Generic answers obvious to recruiters, may contain factual errors
- Alternative: Use AI to brainstorm angles, then write authentic response yourself

**Impersonating Someone Else**
- Example: AI writing resume for different person/background
- Why dangerous: Fundamental dishonesty, will collapse under scrutiny
- Alternative: Present your genuine self authentically

## Best Practices Summary

1. **AI as Editor, Not Author** - You write first draft, AI suggests improvements
2. **Verify Everything** - Never accept AI output without fact-checking
3. **Maintain Your Voice** - Read output aloud; if it doesn't sound like you, rewrite
4. **Stay Defensible** - Every claim should be something you can discuss confidently in interview
5. **Quality Over Speed** - Don't use AI to apply faster; use it to apply better

### Golden Rule
**If you wouldn't say it confidently in an interview while looking the hiring manager in the eye, don't put it in your application.**
